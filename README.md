## How to get started
This web app should work in most modern browsers.
Here are the steps to get start:
1. Run `npm i` from this project's directory. If you don't have npm, you will need to install node, which will install npm for you. I would use `brew` to install. `brew install node` ([npm install how-to](https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x)).
2. After that is complete, run `npm run build'.
3. If you don't have the npm package `serve`, run `npm i -g serve`.
4. After that is installed, run `serve -s build` which whill serve the build files.
5. Go to `localhost:5000` in your browser.

If you would like to mess around with the code and have it hot reload, you can follow similar directions but run `npm run start` instead of `npm run build`.
Also, it will be hosted at `localhost:3000`.
